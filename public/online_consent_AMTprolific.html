        Project Title: Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy
        Aging.<br />
        Project Sponsors: Brown University and the National Institute on Aging<br />
        Principal-Investigator: Matthew R Nassar, Ph.D.
      </p>

      <p>
        PURPOSE: The study examines how learning, memory and decision making change with age and to
        better understand the reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        PROCEDURES: You will be asked to complete several computerized tasks. You may be asked to
        complete brief surveys, medical history questions, and demographic questions on the
        computer.
      </p>

      <p>
        TIME INVOLVED: The study will involve X sessions, each lasting approximately X minutes of
        your time.
      </p>

      <p>
        COMPENSATION: You will receive $0.14/minute for completion of this study. Some computerized
        tasks may offer performance bonuses of up to $5 per session.
      </p>

      <p>
        RISKS: You might get tired while doing the tasks or have some discomfort from sitting still
        and minimizing your movement. The tasks will include breaks at which time you will be
        allowed to stretch and move as necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        BENEFITS: There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this research study.
